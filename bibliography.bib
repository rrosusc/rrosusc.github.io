abstract = {A path planning technique for fixed-base robot manipulators consists of a Mapping Phase and a Path Planning Phase. The Mapping Phase employs a closed-form relationship to map from object space to C-Space for a manipulator with revolute joints. The Path Planning Phase consists of develop- ing a potential field around each object in C-Space and using the resulting field to choose an appropriate path. To accom- plish this, a trial path is chosen and then modified under the influence of the potential field. Considering the entire path greatly reduces the probability of becoming trapped in a local minimum, making the method effective for global planning},

Collision avoidance, tradi-tionally considered a high level planning problem, can be effectively distributed between different levels of control, al-lowing real-time robot operations in a complex environment. This method has been extended to moving obstacles by using a time-varying artificial potential field. We have applied this obstacle avoidance scheme to robot arm mechanisms and have used a new approach to the general problem of real-time manipulator control. We reformulated the manipulator con-trol problem as direct control of manipulator motion in oper-ational space{\&}mdash;the space in which the task is originally described{\&}mdash;rather than as control of the task's corresponding joint space motion obtained only after geometric and kinematic transformation. Outside the obstacles' regions of influ-ence, we caused the end effector to move in a straight line with an upper speed limit. The artificial potential field ap-proach has been extended to collision avoidance for all ma-nipulator links. In addition, a joint space artificial potential field is used to satisfy the manipulator internal joint con-straints. This method has been implemented in the COSMOS system for a PUMA 560 robot. Real-time collision avoidance demonstrations on moving obstacles have been performed by using visual sensing.},

The Lagrange-d'Alembert formulation is used to obtain a concise description of the dynamics of the system, which is subject to nonholonomic constraints. The complexity of the model is increased by introducing kinematic redundancy, which is created when a multilinked manipulator is used. The kinematic redundancy is resolved by decomposing the mobile manipulator into two subsystems: the mobile platform and the manipulator. The re-dundancy resolution scheme employs a nonlinear interaction-control algorithm, which is developed and applied to coordinate the two sub-systems' controllers. The subsystem controllers are independently designed, based on each subsystem's dynamic characteristics. Sim-ulation results show the promise of the developed algorithm.},

abstract = {For a mobile manipulator to be used in areas such as offices and houses, it is desirable that the mobile platform be small sized. In the case of a small-sized platform, the mobile manipulator may tip over when moving at high speed or executing tasks in the presence of disturbances. Therefore, it is necessary to simultaneously consider both stabilization and manipulation while coordinating vehicle mo-tion and manipulator motion. In this paper, we first present the con-cept of the valid stable region to evaluate stability in the presence of disturbances. Next, we propose a method for coordinating vehicle motion planning including manipulator configuration, and manipu-lator motion planning including platform stability. Then, the optimal problem of vehicle motion is formulated, taking into account vehi-cle dynamics, manipulator workspace, and system stability. Also, the manipulator motion is derived, considering stability compensa-tion and manipulator configuration. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed method is demonstrated by simulation examples.},

The integration of a manipulator and a mobile robot base places special demands on the vehicle's drive system. For smooth, accurate motion and coordination with an on-board manipulator, a holonomic vibration-free wheel system that can be dynamically controlled is needed. In this paper, we present the design and development of a powered caster vehicle (PCV), which is shown to possess the desired mechanical properties. To dynamically control the PCV, a new approach for modeling and controlling the dynamics of this parallel redundant system is proposed.

@article{Lavalle2001,
abstract = {This paper presents the first randomized approach to kinodynamic planning (also known as trajectory planning or trajectory design). The task is to determine control inputs to drive a robot from an initial configuration and velocity to a goal configuration and velocity while obeying physically based dynamical models and avoiding obstacles in the robot's environment. The authors consider generic systems that express the nonlinear dynamics of a robot in terms of the robot's high-dimensional configuration space. Kinodynamic planning is treated as a motion-planning problem in a higher dimensional state space that has both first-order differential constraints and obstacle-based global constraints. The state space serves the same role as the configuration space for basic path planning; however, standard ran-domized path-planning techniques do not directly apply to planning trajectories in the state space. The authors have developed a ran-domized planning approach that is particularly tailored to trajectory planning problems in high-dimensional state spaces. The basis for this approach is the construction of rapidly exploring random trees, which offer benefits that are similar to those obtained by success-ful randomized holonomic planning methods but apply to a much broader class of problems. Theoretical analysis of the algorithm is given. Experimental results are presented for an implementation that computes trajectories for hovercrafts and satellites in cluttered environments, resulting in state spaces of up to 12 dimensions.},

It provides a efficient and convenient framework to design a mobile manipulator controller as well as its action plans. Combing the event-based planning and control method with the nonlinear feedback technique, a task level action controller is designed. An online kinematic redundancy resolution scheme has also been developed. The system stability has been proven in the normal operation as well as in the case of appearance of unexpected obstacles. Furthermore, a robotic task involving both position and output force control of mobile manipulator can be easily planned. The proposed unified model approach has been implemented and tested on a mobile manipulator consisting of a Nomadic XR4000 and a Puma 560 robot arm. A cart pushing task is used to demonstrate the efficiency and effectiveness of the proposed approach.},

abstract = {In real world planning problems, time for deliberation is often limited. Anytime planners are well suited for these problems: they find a feasi-ble solution quickly and then continually work on improving it until time runs out. In this paper we propose an anytime heuristic search, ARA*, which tunes its performance bound based on available search time. It starts by finding a suboptimal solution quickly using a loose bound, then tightens the bound progressively as time allows. Given enough time it finds a provably optimal solution. While improving its bound, ARA* reuses previous search efforts and, as a result, is significantly more effi-cient than other anytime search methods. In addition to our theoretical analysis, we demonstrate the practical utility of ARA* with experiments on a simulated robot kinematic arm and a dynamic path planning prob-lem for an outdoor rover.},

abstract = {This paper presents the solution at the control feedback level to the inverse kinematics problem for mobile manipulators operating in both obstacle-free task spaces and task spaces including obstacles. Using the Frechet differential of a certain criterion function, the fully specified system of algebraic and differential equations of the minimal amount has been obtained to solve the inverse kinematics problem. Based on the Lyapunov stability theory, a full differential form generating the mobile manipulator trajectory, whose attractor attained in a finite time fulfills the above system of algebraic and differential equations, has been derived. The problem of both singu-larity and collision avoidance is solved here based on a concept of (local) velocity perturbation which results in continuous mobile ma-nipulator velocities near singularities and obstacles. The numerical simulation results carried out for a mobile manipulator consisting of a nonholonomic wheel and a holonomic manipulator of two revolute kinematic pairs, operating in both an obstacle-free task space and task space including obstacles, illustrate the trajectory performance of the proposed solution scheme.},

Assuming an approximated path is given by B-spline curves, path following is defined by requiring manipulator links to remain approximately tangent to these curves. The algorithm decouples manipulator links and establishes each link's position relative to the curve using a numerical approach. As a result, the whole link achieves manoeuvring around the curve. A robust propagation procedure between links is also performed, which checks every link's position and moves the links coming after the most recently moved link. These features lead to handling a huge number of degrees of freedom (DOFs) while keeping tight manoeuvring ability of highly redundant manipulators as illustrated with several examples.},

The objective is to study a fluid and coordinated control of dexterous limbs on a mobile robot. The system has been demonstrated interacting with people, tools, and urban interfaces built for humans. Human interactions have included manually exchanging objects with humans, following people, and tracking people with hand held objects such as flashlights. Like other configurations of the Robonaut family, the upper body provides dexterity for using tools such as wire cutters, shovels, space flight gear, and handling flexible tethers and fabrics. The Segway base is a custom version called the Robotic Mobility Platform (RMP) built for DARPA, and provided to NASA for this collaborative effort. The RMP's active balance gives Robonaut a relatively small footprint for its height, allowing it to pass through doors and elevators built for humans, and use wheelchair accessible ramps and lifts. Lessons learned from this development are presented to improve the design of future mobile manipulation systems, and the Segway base provides mobility to Robonaut for Earth based testing.},

We show the inadequacy of traditional distance-estimation heuristics for tasks of this type and present alternative heuristics that are more appropriate for multiple-goal search. In particular, we introduce the marginal-utility heuristic, which estimates the cost and the benefit of exploring a subtree below a search node. We developed two methods for online learning of the marginal-utility heuristic. One is based on local similarity of the partial marginal utility of sibling nodes, and the other generalizes marginal-utility over the state feature space.

abstract = {In this paper, we examine the development of a kinematically compatible control framework for a modular system of wheeled mobile manipulators that can team up to cooperatively transport a common payload. Each individually autonomous mobile manipulator consists of a differentially-driven Wheeled Mobile Robot (WMR) with a mounted two degree-of-freedom (d.o.f) revolute-jointed, planar and passive manipulator arm. The composite wheeled vehicle, formed by placing a payload at the end-effectors of two (or more) such mobile manipulators, has the capability to accommodate, detect and correct both instantaneous and finite relative configuration errors.The kinematically-compatible motion-planning/control framework developed here is intended to facilitate maintenance of all kinematic (holonomic and nonholonomic) constraints within such systems. Given an arbitrary end-effector trajectory, each individual mobile-manipulator's bi-level hierarchical controller first generates a kinematically-feasible desired trajectory for the WMR base, which is then tracked by a suitable lower-level posture stabilizing controller. Two variants of system-level cooperative control schemes-leader-follower and decentralized control-are then created based on the individual mobile-manipulator control scheme. Both methods are evaluated within an implementation framework that emphasizes both virtual prototyping (VP) and hardware-in-the-loop (HIL) experimentation. Simulation and experimental results of an example of a two-module system are used to highlight the capabilities of a real-time local sensor-based controller for accommodation, detection and corection of relative formation errors.},

The op-erational space framework provides the control structure needed to achieve decoupled task dynamics. A virtual spring connects the mas-ter and slave systems and a closed-loop force controller compensates for the dynamics of the slave system, rendering transparent the ef-fector of the slave robotic system. The active force control approach allows the desired motion and contact forces to be combined in a single force command. The required performance and robustness of force control are achieved by a full state reconstruction using a mod-ified Kalman estimator, which addresses disturbances and modeling uncertainties. The performance of both telepresence and force con-trol are further improved by on-line stiffness estimation of the object in contact with the effector. The redundancy of the mobile manipulation system is addressed through a decoupled decomposition of task and posture dynamics.},

abstract = {— This paper presents the Discrete Search Lead-ing continuous eXploration (DSLX) planner, a multi-resolution approach to motion planning that is suitable for challenging problems involving robots with kinodynamic constraints. Initially the method decomposes the workspace to build a graph that encodes the physical adjacency of the decomposed regions. This graph is searched to obtain leads, that is, sequences of regions that can be explored with sampling-based tree methods to generate solution trajectories. Instead of treating the discrete search of the adjacency graph and the exploration of the continuous state space as separate components, DSLX passes information from one to the other in innovative ways. Each lead suggests what regions to explore and the exploration feeds back information to the discrete search to improve the quality of future leads. Information is encoded in edge weights, which indicate the importance of including the regions associated with an edge in the next exploration step. Computation of weights, leads, and the actual exploration make the core loop of the algorithm. Extensive experimentation shows that DSLX is very versatile. The discrete search can drastically change the lead to reflect new information allowing DSLX to find solutions even when sampling-based tree planners get stuck. Experimental results on a variety of challenging kinodynamic motion planning problems show computational speedups of two orders of magnitude over other widely used motion planning methods.},

abstract = {The concept of C-space entropy for sensor-based exploration and view planning for general robot-sensor systems has been introduced in [?], [?], [?], [?]. The robot plans the next sensing action (also called the next best view) to maximize the expected C-space entropy reduction, (known as Maximal expected Entropy Reduction, or MER). It gives priority to those areas that increase the maneuverable space around the robot, taking into account its physical size and shape, thereby facilitating reachability for further views. However, previous work had assumed a Poisson point process model for obstacle distribution in the physical space, a simplifying assumption. In this paper we derive an expression for MER criterion assuming an occupancy grid map, a commonly used representation for workspace representation in much of the mobile robot community. This model is easily obtained from typical range sensors such as laser range finders, stereo vision, etc., and furthermore, we can incorporate occlusion constraints and their effect in the MER formulation, making it more realistic. Simulations show that even for holonomic mobile robots with relatively simple geometric shapes (such as a rectangle), the MER criterion yields improvement in exploration efficiency (number of views needed to explore the C-space) over physical space based criteria.},

@article{Robinson2007,
abstract = { Manipulation systems for planetary exploration operate under severe limitations due to power and weight restrictions and extreme environmental conditions. Typically such systems employ carefully calibrated stereo cameras and carefully calibrated manipulators to achieve precision on the order of ten millimeters with respect to instrument placement activities. The environmental and functional restrictions under which these systems are used limit the operational accuracy of these approaches. This paper presents a novel approach to stereo-based manipulation designed to robustly achieve high precision levels despite the aforementioned limitations. The basic principle of the approach, known as Hybrid Image Plane/Stereo (HIPS) Manipulation, is the generation of camera models through direct visual sensing of the manipulator's end-effector. The HIPS method estimates and subsequently uses these models to position the manipulator at a target location specified in the image-planes of a stereo camera pair using stereo correlation and triangulation. In-situ estimation and adaptation of the manipulator/camera models in this method accounts for changes in the system configuration, thus ensuring consistent precision for the life of the mission. The end result is a increase in positioning precision by a factor of approximately two for a limited version of HIPS, and an order of magnitude increase in positioning precision for the full on-line version of HIPS. },

In preparation for this traverse, Earth-based tests were performed using Mars weight vehicles. These vehicles were driven over Mars analog bedrock, cohesive soil, and cohesionless sand at various slopes. Vehicle slip was characterized on each of these terrains versus slope for direct upslope driving. Results show that slopes up to 22 degrees are traversable on smooth bedrock and that slopes up to 28 degrees are traversable on some cohesive soils. In cohesionless sand, results show a sharp transition between moderate slip on 10 degree slopes and vehicle embedding at 17 degrees. For cohesionless sand, data are also presented showing the relationship between vehicle slip and wheel sinkage. Side by side testing of the Mars Exploration Rover test vehicle and the Mars Science Laboratory test vehicle show how increased wheel diameter leads to better slope climbing ability in sand for vehicles with nearly identical ground pressure. Lastly, preliminary data from Curiosity's initial driving on Mars are presented and compared to the Earth-based testing, showing good agreement for the driving done during the first 250 Martian days.},

Map building generates a terrain map using the measurements of laser and ultrasonic rangefinders, and path planning uses the map to define an obstacle-free path for the detector. Map building involves sensor fusion to tackle the uncertainties associated with range measurement. Fusion takes place in a hierarchical filtering process that updates the map in real time and also optimizes the scanning process based on the terrain type. The filtering process includes a proposed fuzzy adaptive Kalman filter in which the gain of the filter is adapted using a fuzzy model that characterizes the terrain. The efficiency of the proposed map building and path planning methods has been verified by experiments on a prototype mine detector robot.},

The mathematical model will be used to achieve optimum autonomous control of the developed mobile robot as an office service robot. Omni-directional mobile platforms have improved performance in congested environments and narrow aisles, such as those found in factory workshops, offices, warehouses, hospitals, etc.},

abstract = {We present an optimization-based approach to grasping and path planning for mobile manipulators. We focus on pick-and-place operations, where a given object must be moved from its start configuration to its goal configuration by the robot. Given only the start and goal configurations of the object and a model of the robot and scene, our algorithm finds a grasp and a trajectory for the robot that will bring the object to its goal configuration. The algorithm consists of two phases: optimization and planning. In the optimization phase, the optimal robot configurations and grasp are found for the object in its start and goal configurations using a co-evolutionary algorithm. In the planning phase, a path is found connecting the two robot configurations found by the optimization phase using Rapidly-Exploring Random Trees (RRTs). We benchmark our algorithm and demonstrate it on a 10 DOF mobile manipulator performing complex pick-and-place tasks in simulation.},

The UMass/Smith ASSIST framework aims to alleviate the strain on centralized medical providers and community services as their clientele grow, re- duce the delays in service, support independent living, and therefore, improve the quality of life for the up-coming elder population.We propose a closed loop methodology wherein innovative technical systems are field tested in assisted care facilities and analyzed by social scientists to create and re- fine residential systems for independent living.

The mobile manipulator provides client ser- vices and serves as an embodied interface for remote service providers.

abstract = {This paper introduces a novel and general real-time adaptive motion planning (RAMP) approach suitable for planning trajectories of high-DOF or redundant robots, such as mobile manipulators, in dynamic environments with moving obstacles of unknown trajectories. The RAMP approach enables simultaneous path and trajectory planning and simultaneous planning and execution of motion in real time. It facilitates real-time optimization of trajectories under various optimization criteria, such as minimizing energy and time and maximizing manipulability. It also accommodates partially specified task goals of robots easily. The approach exploits redundancy in redundant robots (such as locomotion versus manipulation in a mobile manipulator) through loose coupling of robot configuration variables to best achieve obstacle avoidance and optimization objectives. The RAMP approach has been implemented and tested in simulation over a diverse set of task environments, including environments with multiple mobile manipulators. The results (and also the accompanying video) show that the RAMP planner, with its high efficiency and flexibility, not only handles a single mobile manipulator well in dynamic environments with various obstacles of unknown motions in addition to static obstacles, but can also readily and effectively plan motions for each mobile manipulator in an environment shared by multiple mobile manipulators and other moving obstacles.},

abstract = {— We present an approach to path planning for manipulators that uses Workspace Goal Regions (WGRs) to specify goal end-effector poses. Instead of specifying a discrete set of goals in the manipulator's configuration space, we specify goals more intuitively as volumes in the manipulator's workspace. We show that WGRs provide a common framework for describing goal regions that are useful for grasping and manipulation. We also describe two randomized planning algorithms capable of planning with WGRs. The first is an extension of RRT-JT that interleaves exploration using a Rapidly-exploring Random Tree (RRT) with exploitation using Jacobian-based gradient descent toward WGR samples. The second is the IKBiRRT algorithm, which uses a forward-searching tree rooted at the start and a backward-searching tree that is seeded by WGR samples. We demonstrate both simulation and experimental results for a 7DOF WAM arm with a mobile base performing reaching and pick-and-place tasks. Our results show that planning with WGRs provides an intuitive and powerful method of specifying goals for a variety of tasks without sacrificing efficiency or desirable completeness properties.},

abstract = {We address the motion planning problem for a manipulator system with base pose uncertainty, e.g., when the manipulator is mounted on a mobile base. Using a particle based representation for the uncertainty, we extend the PRM (probabilistic roadmap) approach to deal with this base uncertainty. Because of the uncertainty, a path for the manipulator is associated with a probability of being collision-free, which fundamentally changes the nature of the PRM's query phase. We plan for a shortest path such that the probability of the manipulator being collision-free is higher than a user defined threshold, were the manipulator to follow the path. The path query problem becomes a collision probability constrained shortest path problem (CP-CSPP), and is shown as NP-hard w.r.t. the number of the particles [1]. We then present a lazy query algorithm, called Lazy-CPC-PRM (collision probability constrained LazyPRM), based on a k-shortest path algorithm in conjunction with a labeling algorithm. Lazy-CPC-PRM exploits a key insight that if a portion of a path considered by the algorithm is invalid (the probability of it being collision-free is less than a threshold) or is dominated by another sub-path, then all the longer paths containing this portion can not be the solution path. This leads to significant efficiency gains in practice. Although, worst case complexity is exponential in the number of particles, we empirically show the effectiveness of our query algorithm with 30 particles for a simulated 3-dof manipulator mounted on a mobile base. {\textcopyright} 2009 IEEE.},

In planning for robotic manipulation however, these techniques are commonly thought of as impractical due to the high-dimensionality of the plan-ning problem. In this paper, we present a heuristic search-based manipulation planner that does deal effectively with the high-dimensionality of the problem. The planner achieves the required efficiency due to the following three factors: (a) its use of informative yet fast-to-compute heuristics; (b) its use of basic (small) motion primitives as atomic actions; and (c) its use of ARA* search which is an anytime heuristic search with provable bounds on solution suboptimality. Our experimental analysis on a real mobile manipulation platform with a 7-DOF robotic manipulator shows the ability of the planner to solve manipulation in cluttered spaces by generating consistent, low-cost motion trajectories while providing guarantees on completeness and bounds on suboptimality.},

Once provided with a 3D location via brief illumination with a laser pointer, the robot autonomously approaches the location and then either grasps the nearest object or places an object. We describe our implementation in detail, while highlighting design principles and themes, including the use of specialized behaviors, task-relevant features, and low-dimensional representations. We also present evaluations of EL-E's performance relative to common forms of variation. We tested EL-E's ability to approach and grasp objects from the 25 object categories that were ranked most important for robotic retrieval by motor-impaired patients from the Emory ALS Center. Although reliability varied, EL-E succeeded at least once with objects from 21 out of 25 of these categories. EL-E also approached and grasped a cordless telephone on 12 different surfaces including floors, tables, and counter tops with 100{\%} success.

abstract = {Path planning quickly becomes computationally hard as the dimensionality of the state-space increases. In this paper, we present a planning algorithm intended to speed up path plan-ning for high-dimensional state-spaces such as robotic arms. The idea behind this work is that while planning in a high-dimensional state-space is often necessary to ensure the fea-sibility of the resulting path, large portions of the path have a lower-dimensional structure. Based on this observation, our algorithm iteratively constructs a state-space of an adaptive dimensionality–a state-space that is high-dimensional only where the higher dimensionality is absolutely necessary for finding a feasible path. This often reduces drastically the size of the state-space, and as a result, the planning time and mem-ory requirements. Analytically, we show that our method is complete and is guaranteed to find a solution if one ex-ists, within a specified suboptimality bound. Experimentally, we apply the approach to 3D vehicle navigation (x, y, head-ing), and to a 7 DOF robotic arm on the Willow Garage's PR2 robot. The results from our experiments suggest that our method can be substantially faster than some of the state-of-the-art planning algorithms optimized for those tasks.},

We treat motion planning as an optimization problem, to search for a smooth trajectory that minimizes costs corresponding to collisions and constraints. Specifically, we consider trajectories of a fixed duration T , discretized into N waypoints, equally spaced in time. In order to keep the notation simple, we first derive the algo-rithm for a 1-dimensional trajectory; this naturally extends later to multiple dimensions. This 1-dimensional discretized trajectory is represented as a vector $\theta$ ∈ R N . We assume that the start and goal of the trajectory are given, and are kept fixed during the optimization process. We now present an algorithm that iteratively optimizes this discretized trajectory, subject to arbitrary state-dependent costs. While we keep the cost function general in this section, Section IV discusses our formulation for obstacle, constraint, energy, and smoothness costs. We start with the following optimization problem: mi{\~{n}} $\theta$ E N i=1 q $\theta$ i) + 1 $\theta$ T $\theta$ (1) wher $\theta$ = N ($\theta$, $\Sigma$) is a noisy parameter vector with mean $\theta$ and variance $\Sigma$. q $\theta$ i) is an arbitrary state-dependent cost function, which can include obstacle costs, constraints and torques.

abstract = {In this paper, we present Batch Informed Trees (BIT*), a planning algorithm based on unifying graph- and sampling-based planning techniques. By recognizing that a set of samples describes an implicit random geometric graph (RGG), we are able to combine the efficient ordered nature of graph-based techniques, such as A*, with the anytime scalability of sampling-based algorithms, such as Rapidly-exploring Random Trees (RRT). BIT* uses a heuristic to efficiently search a series of increasingly dense implicit RGGs while reusing previous information. It can be viewed as an extension of incremental graph-search techniques, such as Lifelong Planning A* (LPA*), to continuous problem domains as well as a generalization of existing sampling-based optimal planners. It is shown that it is probabilistically complete and asymptotically optimal. We demonstrate the utility of BIT* on simulated random worlds in {\$}\backslashmathbb{\{}R{\}}{\^{}}2{\$} and {\$}\backslashmathbb{\{}R{\}}{\^{}}8{\$} and manipulation problems on CMU's HERB, a 14-DOF two-armed robot. On these problems, BIT* finds better solutions faster than RRT, RRT*, Informed RRT*, and Fast Marching Trees (FMT*) with faster anytime convergence towards the optimum, especially in high dimensions.},

@article{Sucan2011,
abstract = {This paper introduces the concept of a task motion multigraph, a data structure that can be used to reveal a difficulty specific to mobile manipulation: the possibility of planning in different state spaces in order to achieve the same goal. The different options reflect the mobile manipulator's ability to use different hardware components to perform a required task. For instance, a humanoid robot can open a door with its left arm or with its right arm. Thus, motion planning can be performed in the left arm's state space or in the right arm's state space. Given the specification of a task, it is shown how to encode the available motion planning options in a task motion multigraph. An algorithm that computes sequences of motion plans for mobile manipulators using the newly introduced notion is presented and evaluated. The algorithm makes use of information from the task motion multigraph to prioritize the spaces for which motion plans are computed. Experimental results show that reduced planning times can be obtained when considering the available planning options.},

abstract = {Reliability and availability are major concerns for autonomous systems. A personal robot has to solve complex tasks, such as loading a dishwasher or folding laundry, which are very difficult to automate robustly. In order for a robot to perform better in those applications, it needs to be capable of accepting help from a human operator. Shared autonomy is a system model based on human-robot dialogue. This work aims at bridging the gap between full human control and full autonomy for tasks in the domain of personal robotics. One of the hardest problems for personal robotic systems is perception: perceiving and inferring about objects in the robot's environment. We present a system capable of solving the perceptual inference in combination with a human, such that a human operator functions as a resource for the robot and helps to compensate for limitations of autonomy. In this paper, we show how a human-robot team can work together effectively to solve complex perception tasks. We present a system that asks a human operator to identify objects it doesn't recognize or find. In various experiments with the PR2 robot we show that this shared autonomy system performs more robustly than the robot system alone and that it is capable of tasks which are difficult to accomplish by an autonomous agent.},

In this paper, we present a tactile perception strategy that allows a mobile robot with tactile sensors in its gripper to measure a generic set of tactile features while manipulating an object. We propose a switching velocity-force controller that grasps an object safely and reveals, at the same time, its deformation properties. By gently rolling the object, the robot can extract additional information about the contents of the object. As an application, we show that a robot can use these features to distinguish the internal state of bottles and cans-purely from tactile sensing-from a small training set. The robot can distinguish open from closed bottles and cans and full ones from empty ones. We also show how the high-frequency component in tactile information can be used to detect movement inside a container, e.g., in order to detect the presence of liquid. To prove that this is a hard recognition problem, we also conducted a comparative study with 17 human test subjects. The recognition rates of the human subjects were comparable with that of the robot.},

These distributions can be used to assess the quality of the path, for instance by computing the probability of avoiding collisions. Many methods can be used to generate the needed ensemble of candidate paths from which the best path is selected; in this paper we report results using the RRT-algorithm. We study the performance of LQG-MP with simulation experiments in three scenarios involving a kinodynamic car-like robot, multi-robot planning with differential-drive robots, and a 6-DOF manipulator.},

In domains sparsely populated by obstacles, the heuristics used by sampling-based planners to navigate narrow passages can be needlessly complex; further-more, additional post-processing is required to remove the jerky or extraneous motions from the paths that such planners generate. In this paper, we present CHOMP, a novel method for con-tinuous path refinement that uses covariant gradient techniques to improve the quality of sampled trajectories. Our optimization technique converges over a wider range of input paths and is able to optimize higher-order dynamics of trajectories than previous path optimization strategies. As a result, CHOMP can be used as a standalone motion planner in many real-world planning queries. The effectiveness of our proposed method is demonstrated in manipulation planning for a 6-DOF robotic arm as well as in trajectory generation for a walking quadruped robot.},

abstract = {Collision-free navigation in cluttered environ- ments is essential for any mobile manipulation system. Tra- ditional navigation systems have relied on a 2D grid map pro- jected from a 3D representation for efficiency. This approach, however, prevents navigation close to objects in situations where projected 3D configurations are in collision within the 2D grid map even if actually no collision occurs in the 3D environment. Accordingly, when using such a 2D representation for planning paths of a mobile manipulation robot, the number of planning problems which can be solved is limited and suboptimal robot paths may result. We present a fast, integrated approach to solve path planning in 3D using a combination of an efficient octree-based representation of the 3D world and an anytime search-based motion planner. Our approach utilizes a combination of multi-layered 2D and 3D representations to improve planning speed, allowing the generation of almost real- time plans with bounded sub-optimality. We present extensive experimental results with the two-armed mobile manipulation robot PR2 carrying large objects in a highly cluttered environ- ment. Using our approach, the robot is able to efficiently plan and execute trajectories while transporting objects, thereby often moving through demanding, narrow passageways.},

The proposed mechanism provides a clear advantage in which all the actuators can be separated from the working joints. Thus, the mechanism is able to select the Center of Mass (CoM) and the Zero-Moment Point (ZMP) in arbitrary points without any support from ZMP controller or ZMP compensation method. To confirm efficiency of the new manipulator, this paper addresses a design method using the simplified beam theory, based on the well-known Finite Element Method (FEM) for structural stiffness analysis of linkages. The reason behind this is that the CoM and ZMP are dependent on the weight of the motors and the linkages. Ultimately, we show the efficiency of the proposed stackable manipulator through simulations and experiments.},

abstract = {Unstructured human environments present a substantial challenge to effective robotic operation. Mobile manipulation in human environments requires dealing with novel unknown objects, cluttered workspaces, and noisy sensor data. We present an approach to mobile pick and place in such environments using a combination of two-dimensional (2-D) and three-dimensional (3-D) visual processing, tactile and proprioceptive sensor data, fast motion planning, reactive control and monitoring, and reactive grasping. We demonstrate our approach by using a two-arm mobile manipulation system to pick and place objects. Reactive components allow our system to account for uncertainty arising from noisy sensors, inaccurate perception (e.g., object detection or registration), or dynamic changes in the environment. We also present a set of tools that allows our system to be easily configured within a short time for a new robotic system.},

The framework plans rearrangement of clutter using non-prehensile actions, such as pushing. PUshing actions are also used to manipulate object pose uncertainty. The framework uses an action library that is derived analytically from the mechanics of pushing and is provable conservative. The framework reduces the problem to one of combinatorial search, and demonstrates planning times on the order of seconds. With the extra functionality, our planner succeeds where traditional grasp planners fail, and works under high uncertainty by utilizing hte funneling effect of pushing.

@article{Walter2012,
abstract = {We describe a vision-based algorithm that enables a robot to robustly detect specific objects in a scene following an initial segmentation hint from a human user. The novelty lies in the ability to 'reacquire' objects over extended spatial and temporal excursions within challenging environments based upon a single training example. The primary difficulty lies in achieving an effective reacquisition capability that is robust to the effects of local clutter, lighting variation, and object relocation. We overcome these challenges through an adaptive detection algorithm that automatically generates multiple-view appearance models for each object online. As the robot navigates within the environment and the object is detected from different viewpoints, the one-shot learner opportunistically and automatically incorporates additional observations into each model. In order to overcome the effects of 'drift' common to adaptive learners, the algorithm imposes simple requirements on the geometric consistency of candidate observations. Motivating our reacquisition strategy is our work developing a mobile manipulator that interprets and autonomously performs commands conveyed by a human user. The ability to detect specific objects and reconstitute the user's segmentation hints enables the robot to be situationally aware. This situational awareness enables rich command and control mechanisms and affords natural interaction. We demonstrate one such capability that allows the human to give the robot a 'guided tour' of named objects within an outdoor environment and, hours later, to direct the robot to manipulate those objects by name using spoken instructions. We implemented our appearance-based detection strategy on our robotic manipulator as it operated over multiple days in different outdoor environments. We evaluate the algorithm's performance under challenging conditions that include scene clutter, lighting and viewpoint variation, object ambiguity, and object relocation. The results demonstrate a reacquisition capability that is effective in real-world settings.},

In this way, we exploit the advantages of both frameworks, namely fast planning on grids and the ability to find solutions in situations where grid-based planning fails. Our method computes a global solution by adaptively switching between fast grid-based planning in open spaces and footstep planning in the vicinity of obstacles. To decide which planning framework to use, our approach classifies the environment into regions of different complexity with respect to the traversability. Experiments carried out in a simulated office environment and with a Nao humanoid show that (i) our approach significantly reduces the planning time compared to pure footstep planning and (ii) the resulting plans are almost as good as globally computed optimal footstep paths.},

The input models may correspond to tri-angulated rigid or deformable models and articulated models. Moreover, FCL can perform probabilistic collision checking between noisy point clouds that are captured using cameras or LIDAR sensors. The main benefit of FCL lies in the fact that it provides a unified interface that can be used by various applications. Furthermore, its flexible architecture makes it easier to implement new algorithms within this framework. The runtime performance of the library is comparable to state of the art collision and proximity algorithms.

Minimizing a cost function, e.g. path length, can produce short, reasonable paths. Anytime planners are ideal for this since they find an initial solution quickly and then improve solution quality as time permits. In previous work, we introduced the concept of Experience Graphs, which allow search-based planners to find paths with bounded sub-optimality quickly by reusing parts of previous paths where relevant. Here we extend planning with Experience Graphs to work in an anytime fashion so a first solution is found quickly using prior experience. As time allows, the dependence on this experience is reduced in order to produce closer to optimal solutions. We also demonstrate how Experience Graphs provide a new way of approaching incremental planning as they naturally reuse information when the environment, the starting configuration of the robot or the goal configuration change. Experimentally, we demonstrate the anytime and incremental properties of our algorithm on mobile manipulation tasks in both simulation and on a real PR2 robot.},

Previous approaches focus on cases where objects are in unknown rooms but lying out in the open, which transforms object search into active visual search. However, in real life, objects may be in the back of cupboards occluded by other objects, instead of conveniently on a table by themselves. Extending search to occluded objects requires a more precise model and tighter integration with manipulation. We present a novel generative model for representing container contents by using object co-occurrence information and spatial constraints. Given a target object, a planner uses the model to guide an agent to explore containers where the target is likely, potentially needing to move occluding objects to enable further perception.

Based on the variational principles, this approach involves formulating the path planning problem as constrained minimization of a functional representing the total joint movement over the complete path. We use modified boundary conditions at both ends of the trajectory to find more suitable start and end configurations. The concept of monotonic optimality is introduced in order to optimize the manipulator paths between the resulting end configurations. For obstacle avoidance, volume and proximity based penalizing schemes are developed and used. The presented planner uses a global approach to search for feasible paths and at the same time involves no pre-processing task. A variety of test cases have been presented to establish the efficacy of the presented scheme in providing good quality paths. The extent of advantage accruing out of the measures of free end-configurations and monotonic optimality are also analyzed quantitatively.},

Thus, motion planning for such manipulators is a very computationally challenging problem. However, often robotic manipulators allow the wrist degrees of freedom to be controlled independently from the configuration of the rest of the arm. In this paper we show how to split the high dimensional planning problem into two lower-dimensional sub-problems—planning for the main arm joints and planning for the wrist joints, without losing guarantees on completeness. This approach is an extension of our previously developed framework for planning with adaptive dimensionality. Experimentally, we show that this approach is very effective in speeding up planning for robotic arms on Willow Garage's PR2 platform. We compare our algorithm with several popular alternative approaches for performing motion planning for robotic arms. The results we observe illustrate that our algorithm provides a good balance between planning time, planning success rate, path consistency, and path quality.},

abstract = {— Kinematic planning for robotic arms has been shown to be capable of planning for robust manipulation of static objects. However, this approach falls short when manipulating moving objects such as picking up a jar off of a conveyor belt at a bottling plant. The challenge in carefully picking up moving objects is that these actions require motions that do not involve large decelerations, to avoid jerking the object, as well as figuring out the proper time in which the object can be picked up. We present a search-based kinodynamic motion planning algorithm that generates a time-parameterized trajectory for both the arm and end-effector, capable of carefully picking up the object at the earliest feasible point in its trajectory. To combat the high-dimensionality of the time-parameterized kinodynamic planning problem, our approach employs informative heuristics and adaptive dynamic motion primitives. To validate our approach, we used a 7DOF manipulator on Willow Garage's PR2 robot to pickup objects off of a conveyor belt. We also provide a detailed set of results that demonstrate the planner's ability to generate consistent, low cost trajectories for manipulation.},

abstract = {We address the difficult problem of catching in-flight objects with uneven shapes. This requires the solution of three complex problems: accurate prediction of the trajectory of fast-moving objects, predicting the feasible catching configuration, and planning the arm motion, and all within milliseconds. We follow a programming-by-demonstration approach in order to learn, from throwing examples, models of the object dynamics and arm movement. We propose a new methodology to find a feasible catching configuration in a probabilistic manner. We use the dynamical systems approach to encode motion from several demonstrations. This enables a rapid and reactive adaptation of the arm motion in the presence of sensor uncertainty. We validate the approach in simulation with the iCub humanoid robot and in real-world experiments with the KUKA LWR 4+ (7-degree-of-freedom arm robot) to catch a hammer, a tennis racket, an empty bottle, a partially filled bottle, and a cardboard box.},

abstract = {Advanced modern humanoid robots often have complex manipulators with a large number of degrees of freedom. Thus, motion planning for such manipulators is a very computationally challenging problem. However, often robotic manipulators allow the wrist degrees of freedom to be controlled independently from the configuration of the rest of the arm. In this paper we show how to split the high dimensional planning problem into two lower-dimensional sub-problems - planning for the main arm joints and planning for the wrist joints, without losing guarantees on completeness. This approach is an extension of our previously developed framework for planning with adaptive dimensionality. Experimentally, we show that this approach is very effective in speeding up planning for robotic arms on Willow Garage's PR2 platform. We compare our algorithm with several popular alternative approaches for performing motion planning for robotic arms. The results we observe illustrate that our algorithm provides a good balance between planning time, planning success rate, path consistency, and path quality.},

abstract = {We present a new approach to integrated task and motion planning (ITMP) for robots performing mobile manipulation. In our approach, the user writes a high-level specification that captures partial knowledge about a mobile manipulation setting. In particular, this specification includes a plan outline that syntactically defines a space of plausible integrated plans, a set of logical requirements that the generated plan must satisfy, and a description of the physical space that the robot manipulates. A synthesis algorithm is now used to search for an integrated plan that falls within the space defined by the plan outline, and also satisfies all requirements. Our synthesis algorithm complements continuous motion planning algorithms with calls to a Satisfiability Modulo Theories (SMT) solver. From the scene description, a motion planning algorithm is used to construct a placement graph, an abstraction of a manipulation graph whose paths represent feasible, low-level motion plans. An SMT-solver is now used to symbolically explore the space of all integrated plans that correspond to paths in the placement graph, and also satisfy the constraints demanded by the plan outline and the requirements. Our approach is implemented in a system called Ro-bosynth. We have evaluated Robosynth on a generalization of an ITMP problem investigated in prior work. The experiments demonstrate that our method is capable of generating integrated plans for a number of interesting variations on the problem.},

@article{Cohen2014,
abstract = {Heuristic searches such as the A* search are a popular means of finding least-cost plans due to their generality, strong theoretical guarantees on completeness and optimality, simplicity in implementation and consistent behavior. In planning for robotic manipulation, however, these techniques are commonly thought of as impractical due to the high dimensionality of the planning problem. In this paper, we present a heuristic search-based approach to motion planning for manipulation that does deal effectively with the high dimensionality of the problem. Our approach achieves the necessary efficiency by exploiting the following three key principles: (a) representation of the planning problem with what we call a manipulation lattice graph; (b) use of the ARA* search which is an anytime heuristic search with provable bounds on solution suboptimality; and (c) use of informative yet fast-to-compute heuristics. The paper presents the approach together with its theoretical properties and shows how to apply it to single-arm and dual-arm motion planning with upright constraints on a PR2 robot operating in non-trivial cluttered spaces. An extensive experimental analysis in both simulation and on a physical PR2 shows that, in terms of runtime, our approach is on a par with other most common sampling-based approaches despite the high dimensionality of the problems. In addition, the experimental analysis shows that due to its deterministic cost minimization, the approach generates motions that are of good quality and are consistent, in other words, the resulting plans tend to be similar for similar tasks. For many problems, the consistency of the generated motions is important as it helps make the actions of the robot more predictable for a human controlling or interacting with the robot.},

Considering the critical yet recurring nature of these moves, we let the robot memorize them as state-action sequences and reuse them whenever possible to guide manipulation planning and execution. When combined with a sampling-based generative planner, this guidance helps reduce planning time by deliberately biasing the planning process towards the feasible sequen‐ ces. Additionally, monitoring the execution while reiterat‐ ing the reached sequences improves the task success rate. Our experiments show that this complementary combina‐ tion of the already available partial plans and executions with those generated from scratch yields fast, reliable, and repeatable solutions.},

Nonholonomic constraints in a Pfaffian form are explicitly incorporated to the control algorithm. The problem is shown to be equivalent to some point-to-point control problem whose solution may be easier determined. The motion of the mobile manipulator is planned in order to maximise the manipulability measure, thus to avoid manipulator singularities.

The key to the method is its incremental nature: it locally augments and adapts global motion plans in response to changes in the environment, even if they significantly change the connectivity of the world. The restriction to local changes to a global plan results from the fact that in mobile manipulation, robots can ultimately only rely on their on-board sensors to perceive changes in the world. The proposed method addresses three sub-problems of motion generation with three algorithmic components. The first component reactively adapts plans in response to small, continuous changes. The second augments the plan locally in response to connectivity changes. And the third extracts a global, goal-directed motion from the representation maintained by the first two components. In an experimental evaluation of this method, we show a real-world mobile manipulator executing a whole-body motion task in an initially unknown environment, while incrementally maintaining a plan using only on-board sensors.},

This work introduces a manipulation planning framework with linear temporal logic (LTL) specifications. The use of LTL as the specification language allows the expression of rich and complex manipulation tasks. The framework deals with the state-explosion problem through a novel abstraction technique. Given a robotic system, a workspace consisting of obstacles, manipulable objects, and locations of interest, and a co-safe LTL specification over the objects and locations, the framework computes a motion plan to achieve the task through a synergistic multi-layered planning architecture. The power of the framework is demonstrated through case studies, in which the planner efficiently computes plans for complex tasks. The case studies also illustrate the ability of the framework in intelligently moving away objects that block desired executions without requiring backtracking.},

Besides acceleration, velocity and position constraints, collision avoidance constraints for the mobile base and the arm and Field-of-View constraints have been enforced and extended over the prediction horizon. Navigation performance has been improved by including an additional goal, derived from the classical vortex field approach, to the MPC problem. An experimental validation on a KUKA youBot mobile manipulator has been carried out, showing the online applicability of the presented approach.},

abstract = {In the future mobile dual-arm robots are expected to perform many tasks. Kinematically, the configuration of two manipulators that branch from the same common mobile base results in a serial-to-parallel kinematic structure, which makes inverse kinematic computations non-trivial. The motion of the base has to be decided in a trade-off, taking the needs of both arms into account. We propose to use a Virtual Kinematic Chain (VKC) to specify the common motion of the parallel manipulators, instead of using the two manipulators kinematics directly. With this VKC, we formulate a constraint based programming solution for the robot to respond to external disturbances during task execution. The proposed approach is experimentally verified both in a noise-free illustrative simulation and a real human robot co-manipulation task.},

abstract = {In this system paper we present a novel approach for autonomous, mobile manipulation for agricultural robots. Our target application is mechanical weed control which for example is needed in organic farming. Today, this task is often performed by field workers, whose availability is declining and the quality of their work differs greatly. In addition, manual weeding is a very tedious task with adverse health effects. Hence, mechanical weed control is considered as a prime example for automation. One of the challenges in order to perform the task efficiently is the need for fast plant detection and precise treatment of single plants with a mobile manipulator. The unstructured environment and rough field conditions raise additional challenges. We introduce a first system concept and control design known to handle these issues. In particular, high speed image processing and visual servoing are applied to precisely position a specially designed weeding tool. To evaluate the performance of the mobile manipulator we run experiments with a mobile test vehicle in field-like conditions and demonstrate that our system can treat single plants in less than 1s as it is required to be competitive.},

abstract = {In this paper we present algorithms and experiments for multi-scale assembly of complex structures by multi-robot teams. We also focus on tasks where successful completion requires multiple types of assembly operations with a range of precision requirements. We develop a hierarchical planning approach to multi-scale perception in support of multi-scale manipulation, in which the resolution of the perception operation is matched with the required resolution for the manipulation operation. We demonstrate these techniques in the context of a multi-step task where robots assemble large box-like objects, inspired by the assembly of an airplane wing. The robots begin by transporting a wing panel, a coarse manipulation operation that requires a wide field of view, and gradually shifts to a narrower field of view but with more accurate sensors for part alignment and fastener insertion. Within this framework we also provide for failure detection and recovery: upon losing track of a feature, the robots retract to using wider field of view systems to re-localize. Finally, we contribute collaborative manipulation algorithms for assembling complex large objects. First, the team of robots coordinates to transport large assembly parts which are too heavy for a single robot to carry. Second, the fasteners and parts are co-localized for robust insertion and fastening. We implement these ideas using four KUKA youBot robots and present experiments where our robots successfully complete all 80 of the attempted fastener insertion operations.},

abstract = {— In mobile manipulation planning, it is not un-common for tasks to require thousands of individual motions. Such problems require reasoning about courses of action from the viewpoint of logical objectives as well as the feasibility of individual movements in the configuration space. In discrete representations, planning complexity is exponential in the length of the plan; in mobile manipulation, the set of parameters for an action is often continuous, so we must also cope with an infinite branching factor. Task and motion planning (TAMP) methods integrate logical search with continuous geometric reasoning to address this challenge. We present an algorithm for searching in the space of possible task and motion plans. We develop novel techniques for using statistical machine learning to guide the search process. Our contributions are as follows: 1) we present a complete algorithm for TAMP; 2) we present a randomized local search algorithm for TAMP that is easily formulated as a Markov decision process (MDP); 3) we give a reinforcement learning (RL) algorithm that learns a policy for this MDP; 4) we present a method that trains heuristics for intelligently searching the available space of task plans, given options that address different infeasibilities; and 5) we run experiments to evaluate the performance of our system in a variety of simulated domains. We show significant improvements in performance over the system we build on.},

abstract = {—Motion planning in high dimensional state spaces, such as for mobile manipulation, is a challenging problem. Con- strained manipulation, e.g. opening articulated objects like doors or drawers, is also hard since sampling states on the constrained manifold is expensive. Further, planning for such tasks requires a combination of planning in free space for reaching a desired grasp or contact location followed by planning for the constrained manipulation motion, often necessitating a slow two step process in traditional approaches. In this work, we show that combined planning for such tasks can be dramatically accelerated by providing user demonstrations of the constrained manipulation motions. In particular, we show how such demonstrations can be incorporated into a recently developed framework of plan- ning with experience graphs which encode and reuse previous experiences. We focus on tasks involving articulation constraints, e.g. door opening or drawer opening, where the motion of the object itself involves only a single degree of freedom. We provide experimental results with the PR2 robot opening a variety of such articulated objects using our approach, using full-body manipulation (after receiving kinesthetic demonstrations). We also provide simulated results highlighting the benefits of our approach for constrained manipulation tasks. I.},

In addition, to incorporate holonomic singularity avoidance condition, collision avoidance constraints for the whole mobile manipulator and its final velocity, a suitably defined projection term onto the null space of the extended Jacobian matrix has been introduced. Control limits are maintained by suitable choice of trajectory generator gains. The numerical simulation results carried out for a mobile manipulator consisting of a nonholonomic differentially steered wheeled mobile platform and a holonomic manipulator of two revolute kinematic pairs, operating both in a two-dimensional unconstrained work space and work space including the obstacles, illustrate performance of the proposed trajectory generators.},

abstract = {— During outbreaks of contagious diseases, health-care workers are at high risk for infection due to routine interaction with patients, handling of contaminated materials, and challenges associated with safely removing protective gear. This poses an opportunity for the use of remote-controlled robots that could perform common nursing duties inside hazardous clinical areas, thereby minimizing the exposure of healthcare workers to contagions and other biohazards. This paper describes the development of the prototype system Tele-Robotic Intelligent Nursing Assistant (TRINA), which consists of a mobile manipulator robot, a human operator's console, and operator assistance algorithms which automate or partially-automate tedious and error-prone tasks. Using off-the-shelf robotic and sensing components, total hardware costs are kept under {\$}75,000. The system's capabilities for performing stan-dard nursing tasks are evaluated in the simulation laboratory of a nursing school.},

@article{Lee2017,
abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2017 IEEE. The unified approach algorithm to control a mobile robot is useful in simplifying path planning and inverse kinematics by considering a mobile platform as hypothetical joints. Applying the damped least square method by using the Jacobian prevents the divergence of the joint angle. However, it is possible to violate the nonholonomic constraint on mobility by distorting the Jacobian. In robot manipulation, the end-effector position error due to a violation of the constraint can be fatal, because such an error can damage a nearby object or the robot itself. In this paper, we propose a method that strictly guarantees nonholonomic constraints on a mobile manipulator. We also propose a compensation technique for faster convergence of the position and orientation of the end effector. The effectiveness of the proposed methods was confirmed through simulations.},

The main feature of TOMM is its arms and hands which are covered with robot skin. We exploit the multi-modal tactile information of our robot skin to provide a rich tactile interaction system for robots. In particular, for the robot TOMM, we provide a general control framework, capable of modifying the dynamic behavior of the entire robot, e.g., producing compliance in a non-compliant system. We present the hardware, software and middleware components of the robot and provide a compendium of the base technologies deployed in it. Furthermore, we show some applications and results that we have obtained using this robot.},

Utilizing autonomy enables an unskilled human worker to easily configure a complex robotics system in a setup phase before carrying out fetch and carry operations in the execution phase. In order to perform the given tasks in real industrial production sites, we propose a robotic system consisting of a mobile platform, a torque-controlled manipulator, and an additional sensor head. Multiple sensors are attached which allow for perception of the environment and the objects to be manipulated. This is essential for coping with uncertainties in real-world application. In order to provide an easy-to-use and flexible system, we present a modular software concept which is handled and organized by a hierarchical flow control depending on the given task and environmental requirements. The presented concept for autonomous mobile manipulation is implemented exemplary for industrial manipulation tasks and proven by real-world application in a water pump production site. Furthermore, the concept has also been applied to other robotic systems and other domains for planetary exploration with a rover.},
